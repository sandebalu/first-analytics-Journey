# My First Data Analytics Project

This is my first GitHub repository as a Data Analyst.  
I am learning how to use GitHub for version control, collaboration, and building a data portfolio.

## Goals
- Learn GitHub step-by-step
- Practice commits and version control
- Build confidence before publishing real portfolio projects
